# Web3 Token Launchpad Simulator

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how blockchain token launch systems can be modeled using clean and modular Web3 architecture.

This repository focuses on simulating presale phases, tracking participant allocations, validating contribution limits, and generating launch analytics in a beginner-friendly and production-style format.
